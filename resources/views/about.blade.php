            <h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
            <p>
                Our goal is to help you, help us give you the best restaurant experiences, whilst helping you take advantage of the perks and delicious deals available at your fingertips. We spend our time consulting with restaurants, cafes and more to establish unique food and drink deals catered just for you. Our home town is in London, so we know how challenging it can be to save a few pounds, without losing that quality, so we like to bear in mind that every perk and deal should be at the fore front of your taste buds.

            <p>
                Take note we are not a food delivery company, instead our goal is to entice you to
                visit new places and to explore new favourites, where ever you may be take delight in
                being able to spend quality time at quality establishments with your dearest and your nearest.

            <h3> WHY WE DO IT?</h3>
            <p>
            We discovered many pitfalls for restaurants and consumers, where we took time out and pondered upon; every empty seat, off-peak hour, expired loyalty card, wasted stock, every un-discovered gem may all be of the past, we combined all these issues and founded Plan It In!

                <h3> HOW WE HELP? </h3>
                <p>
                We would like to open an avenue for businesses who donâ€™t dish out perks and deals,
                we all deserve a break and a pat on the back, working 5 days a week,
                responsibilities and commitments, at the end of it like you and me,
                we deserve a treat once in a while and food and experiences are a great way for that,
                well for most of us anyway.
